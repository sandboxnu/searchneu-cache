In the second semester, students apply and consolidate their new legal research and writing skills in addressing an intensive real-life social justice project for a selected client organization. LSSC student teams develop their legal and cooperative problem-solving skills and knowledge while producing real client work of a quality that far exceeds the ordinary expectations of first-year law students.

We will explore the dynamics of natural monopoly markets, public utilities and their regulation, and the interplay of state and federal power in the energy space. We examine coal, natural gas, nuclear power, hydropower, renewables, storage, and efficiency for their impacts and potential as electrical energy sources in a carbon-constrained world. We conclude by investigating the legal potential to proactively foster and sustain a transition to a carbon-sustainable energy economy.",

Asian Americans, the fastest-growing racial group in the United States, number more than 24 million. Community lawyering supports community organizing and responds to community needs. But what does responding to a population of over 24 million mean? How should community lawyers prioritize among issues faced by subsets of this population? By discussing community lawyering efforts such as fighting Southeast Asian deportations, standing against predatory development in neighborhoods like Chinatown, and challenging government surveillance stemming from xenophobia, students consider how community lawyering presents a vision for the practice of law from the ground up, striving to create a world that celebrates humanity and racial difference",

We will explore the phenomenon of police violence directed at racially marginalized communities; consider historical and ongoing opposition to racialized policing; and examine police violence as an instrument of state power. We will consider community efforts to interrupt police violence and legal strategies to reduce harms caused by racialized policing. In addition to our work on race, we will consider how gender, sexual orientation, and class impact policing practices. A principal resource will be the Burnham-Nobles Digital Archive, which houses cases of lynching and other forms of historical homicidal racial violence. This Archive will ground our work in the history of racialized policing and provide a foundation upon which to examine current police operations, practices and policies.",
