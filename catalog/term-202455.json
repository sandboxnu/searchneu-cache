Offers students an opportunity to learn to take a complete view of the development process at the outset—across time, across the portfolio, and at all levels in the organization. This allows for greater insight into a drug’s potential early in the process and leads to a more focused program for promising compounds, including an optimized clinical trial design. It also allows for earlier cessation of unpromising clinical trials, saving time and funds.",
