In the second semester, students apply and consolidate their new legal research and writing skills in addressing an intensive real-life social justice project for a selected client organization. LSSC student teams develop their legal and cooperative problem-solving skills and knowledge while producing real client work of a quality that far exceeds the ordinary expectations of first-year law students.

Students will study historic and contemporary U.S. Supreme Court decisions, as well as advocacy pieces from Native women advocates who practice before the Court today (including amicus briefs). Students will also evaluate the constitutionality of recent legislation passed by the United States Congress to address issues related to safety for Native women, and students will consider the constitutional sources of Congressional authority for recent legislation, as well as emerging arguments from opponents to tribal sovereignty who currently advocate for the Court’s striking down of key statutes, including the Indian Child Welfare Act.",
