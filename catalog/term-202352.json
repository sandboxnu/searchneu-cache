We will discuss the complications of translation (even “good” translation) and how this is further complicated by a) the overlay of generally translating legal concepts, and b) the multitude of cultural/legal experiences in the Spanish-speaking world.  From intake and fact-development, to presenting and cross-examining witnesses, we will discuss how your Spanish knowledge can both complicate and boost your ability to be a great advocate.  A portion of each class will be conducted in Spanish and written and oral proficiency in the language is required.  (If you think you can interview a Spanish-speaking client and record the essential facts in written Spanish then you are at the right level.)  Legal vocabulary will be covered in an effort to introduce students to terminology they might not already know, but the aim of the class is not to teach the Spanish language.  In addition to class participation, a final paper will be required on a topic to be approved by the professor but which should elaborate one of the themes of the class.",
