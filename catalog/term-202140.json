Explores both sides of the ongoing ethical debate, including the potential benefits and limitations of human genome editing, and ramifications for this clinical practice on society. Introduces the methodology for genetic editing, a historical overview of the science and clinical practice of gene editing, and a synopsis of the current regulatory status. Discusses the ethical implications of the utilization of genome editing in humans. Offers students an opportunity to evaluate the utilization of genetic editing to eradicate genetically inherited diseases, the potential to create designer babies, and the socioeconomic impacts of gene editing.",

      "description": "Covers many of the contested economic issues that the United States faces as a nation—the size of government, the national debt, the war on drugs, national healthcare, taxation, and many more. An important social system in any society is the economic system—the allocation of scarce resources. In the large and complex economy of the United States, there is controversy over what goods and services are produced and how they are distributed. To understand the nature and causes of these issues requires a course where theory is a tool of analysis, not the focus. Economics is not value free. Attention is given to the role of ethics and how our moral values shape policy. Course topics vary from semester to semester.",

Explores the importance of economic concepts such as externalities and elasticity in relation to a market-driven economy, price, and consumption behavior. Through the use of elementary life cycle analysis, introduces both the definition and responsibilities of the rational agent as these relate to the establishment of sustainable outcomes. Offers students an opportunity to articulate the relationship between economic growth and climate change and reconcile the historical relationship between social values and sustainable outcomes.",

It nourishes us and makes us sick. It is the source of sublime pleasure and no small anxiety. Food defines us, as much as we define it.

It is a mosaic of different themes that offer a concise overview of science’s greatest minds, ideas, questions, discoveries, theories, and methods while placing all of them within their historical contexts. Emphasizes the profound scientific revolutions of the 20th century—quantum mechanics, biogenetics, and artificial intelligence—that unlocked the secrets of the atom, unraveled the molecule of life, and created the electronic computer. Recognizes significant trends across a wide range of subjects, including medicine, biotechnology, computing and communicating, artificial intelligence and artificial life, and robotics. Discusses the synergism of science, technology, and business on future scientific development.",

      "description": "Offers an interdisciplinary course introducing key themes in gender and sexuality studies. Offers students an opportunity to learn core concepts that inform our understanding of how gender and sexuality are socially constructed and are experienced in everyday life. Drawing on women’s studies, queer studies, masculinity studies, and allied areas, the course analyzes gender, sexuality, and other dimensions of identity; explores critical issues of gender, sex, and power; and studies gendered/sexed identities in both national and transnational contexts. Topics include the gendered conceptions of love, sexuality, and violence; biological arguments about gender and sexuality; the social construction of sexuality and gender; intersections of gender, race, class, and sexuality; masculinities and femininities; theories of sexual difference; gender and the state; and gender and popular culture.",

Addresses how these traditions understand gender and gender roles, seek to shape and control interactions between men and women, regulate sexual relations outside of and within marriage, view sexuality education, regard homosexuality, and examine historical and contemporary approaches to marriage, divorce, and parenting.

May be repeated once.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n        Section information text:\r\n        This course draws on philosophical, scientific, technological, and, most energetically, literary discourses in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries and asks, “How is our understanding of what it means to be human changing?” The course will encourage a critical and historical sensibility and track biological developments from Darwinism to gene editing and technological developments from cyborgs to digital platforms to artificial intelligence. Students will discern how, in select examples from literature and some film, the idea of the human, and its complexities of biology, consciousness, gender, and race, shifts dramatically to what some call the posthuman. Figures includes novelists such as Thomas Pynchon, Richard Powers, Octavia Butler, Margaret Atwood, Samuel Delaney, and Kazuo Ishiguro; scientists and philosophers such as Charles Darwin, Jennifer Doudna, Donna Haraway, and Katherine Hayles; and filmmakers such as David Cronenberg and Jordan Peele.",

Some algorithms will be also introduced (binary search tree, sorting algorithms).  Also, this course will cover data preprocessing and manipulation knowledge (missing value, outlier, duplicate values). And we will also introduce the time series forecasting algorithms. This course will improve the students’ programming skill in python and data processing.",
