Offers students an opportunity to learn to take a complete view of the development process at the outset—across time, across the portfolio, and at all levels in the organization. This allows for greater insight into a drug’s potential early in the process and leads to a more focused program for promising compounds, including an optimized clinical trial design. It also allows for earlier cessation of unpromising clinical trials, saving time and funds.",

In developing target product profiles, strategic regulatory plans, and life-cycle management plans, students appraise key components of regulatory strategies, evaluate core elements of product life cycle in the generation of those strategies, and integrate business needs into regulatory planning. Upon completion of the course, successful students should possess the fundamentals to formulate regulatory strategies supporting product development and life-cycle management and be equipped with a stronger understanding of the high-visibility role regulatory professionals serve in developing sound regulatory strategy.",

Thus, policy officials come to respect and rely on analysts and managers who appreciate this aspect of the decision process. Analysts are deemed most useful when they clarify what is known by laying out the evidence and pointing to cause-and-effect patterns; carefully structure assumptions and argumentation about what is unknown and unknowable; and bring expertise to planning and action on important threats and opportunities. The heavily engaged policymaker has little use for intelligence products that emphasize prediction over explanation and opinion over evidence by assessments that trivialize the challenge of uncertainty by burying honest debate in compromise language and by ignoring high-impact contingencies.",
