Some strategies are easily implemented, while others require advanced expertise. Covers recent advances in technology that make it possible to gather a wealth of data on how people interact within the environments in which they learn, recording each click of the mouse. In education, the use of this data to improve learning is referred to as “learning analytics.”",
