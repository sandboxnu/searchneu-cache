In particular, it will examine how sports, society, and innovations in digital storytelling come together to stimulate important conversations in public discourse around issues such as gender, race, class, and equity. We will examine how digital storytelling can best facilitate engagement with public audiences around such issues. The course will focus on preparing students to research, formulate, and pitch stories to major sports media outlets. A digital platform will be used as a laboratory for class work, allowing students to gain experiential knowledge through direct practice of web-based publishing. Issues of ethics, source diversity, audience engagement, and decision-making in terms of story construction will be central to the course.",

May be repeated without limit.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n        Section information text:\r\n        This course will explore the future of sports journalism as it is manifest in the digital world and aided by technologies. In particular, it will examine how sports, society, and innovations in digital storytelling come together to stimulate important conversations in public discourse around issues such as gender, race, class, and equity. We will examine how digital storytelling can best facilitate engagement with public audiences around such issues. The course will focus on preparing students to research, formulate, and pitch stories to major sports media outlets. A digital platform will be used as a laboratory for class work, allowing students to gain experiential knowledge through direct practice of web-based publishing. Issues of ethics, source diversity, audience engagement, and decision-making in terms of story construction will be central to the course.",
