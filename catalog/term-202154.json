Provides contextual comparisons of programming paradigms drawing on simple examples and case studies, particularly of purely object-oriented, hybrid, and procedural programming. Examines applicability and illustrates techniques and idioms of OOP in the C++ language using a wide variety of in-class examples and via students’ assignments and small projects. Examines methods of OOP analysis and design via the Unified Modeling Language diagrams.",

Using mathematical models, offers students an opportunity to make predictions and inferences in a variety of applications that relate to the fields of engineering, economics, biology, etc. For example, students can use differential calculus to determine what is the most cost-effective speed to drive a car, using the least amount of fuel. These types of problems, called optimization problems, require an understanding of the derivative as a rate of change. The course focuses on how to apply rules and properties of derivatives to model and solve application problems in science, engineering, and technology. As a prelude to MTH 2105, at the end of the semester, the concept of the integral is introduced as a limit of sums and antidifferentiation.",
