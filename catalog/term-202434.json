Uses mathematical models to make predictions and inferences in a variety of applications that relate to the fields of engineering, economics, biology, etc. Focuses primarily on integral calculus and infinite sequences and series. Topics include definite and indefinite integration, the fundamental theorem of calculus, and the use of integration methods in the calculation of areas and volumes and other applications. Introduces improper integrals as well as the study of infinite sequences and series, power series, Taylor series, and techniques for determining convergence or divergence of sequences series. This course offers an in-depth overview of the above concepts and applies them to solve problems in science, engineering, and technology.",
