      "description": "Offers an in-depth critical sociological inquiry into international migration across the world. Addresses the disconnect and tension between the international agreements (principles of international law and legal definitions) and actual experiences and everyday practices of human mobility across borders on the ground. By critically examining how irregular migration has been racialized, securitized, and criminalized in the age of the war on terror, this seminar engages an intersectional analysis of race, ethnicity, religion, gender, and class. Uses ethnographies, case studies, documentaries, and comparative analysis to analyze a wide range of issues from integration, inclusion/exclusion, and racialization of migrants to promigrant movements and native-migrant solidarity.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n        Section information text:\r\n        Class Location: meeting in RP 201B",

This interdisciplinary course offers debates around sex, gender, sexuality, and the body that push beyond binary models reliant on a simple “nature/culture” distinction. Focuses on dynamic and variable aspects of sexuality, sex, and gender within and across cultures, representational forms, and historical periods, analyzing the circumstances in which they undergo significant challenge or transformation. Uses particular paradigmatic “case studies” to push hard at the boundaries of sex and gender and to dialogue around contesting conceptualizations of “the body,” “sex,” and “gender,” particularly as they circulate in specific discourses of feminism, queer theory, and poststructuralism; ethnic studies; critical race theory; and cultural studies.",
