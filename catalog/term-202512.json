On a range of issues, lawyers are bringing human rights home. They are using human rights mechanisms of the United Nations and Inter-American Human Rights system, drawing on international human rights and comparative foreign law in litigation before U.S. courts, and engaging in other human rights-based advocacy such as documentation, organizing, and human rights education. Advocates find that a human rights approach provides important strategic leverage and highlights the interdependence of economic, social, cultural, civil, and political rights. We will use skills exercises, assignments and real-world problems to develop practical skills to address policies on local, state and national levels, and to support social movements.",

We will approach this question by examining how the law and legal institutions shape racial identity and how ideas about race shape legal institutions. The course will also consider tensions and debates within critical race theory and among race scholars. We will excavate the stakes of these debates and the consequences (intended and unintended) of various legal reform projects designed to address racial inequality.",

The purpose of this course is to examine significant developments in white collar criminal law through the analysis of blackletter law, case studies and law enforcement techniques.\n\nThe Course Overview is for general guidance and changes may be made as the class progresses. From time to time supplementary readings (e.g., SEC releases or other public documents) may be assigned throughout the semester.",
