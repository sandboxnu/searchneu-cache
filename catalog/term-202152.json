Focuses on how international and U.S. intellectual property protections impact both innovation incentives and access to medicines. Emphasizes IP rules impacting low- and middle-income countries, pressures seeking to increase IP protections, and flexibilities existing under international law alongside new approaches that might accelerate and ease access to needed medicines both domestically and abroad. International human rights instruments clearly articulate a “right to health” and a right to the benefits of scientific advancement, but the human right of equitable and affordable access to medicines of assured quality and other health technologies is less developed.",
