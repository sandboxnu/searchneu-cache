An amicus curiae is someone who, though not a party to a lawsuit, adds their voice because they have an interest in the outcome. Amicus briefs can influence judges by providing legal or policy analysis, or factual information, not supplied by the litigants. In this course, students research and draft amicus briefs for the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, with guidance from experienced appellate counsel. Exceptional research and writing skills are required. Useful prerequisites are Legal Writing Workshop, Advanced Legal Research, or Appellate Practice. Students can apply by submitting a resumé and unofficial transcript to the instructor.",

Advocates find that a human rights approach provides important strategic leverage and highlights the interdependence of economic, social, cultural, civil, and political rights. We will use skills exercises, assignments and real-world problems to develop practical skills to address policies on local, state and national levels, and to support social movements.",
