Offers students an opportunity to learn to take a complete view of the development process at the outset—across time, across the portfolio, and at all levels in the organization. This allows for greater insight into a drug’s potential early in the process and leads to a more focused program for promising compounds, including an optimized clinical trial design. It also allows for earlier cessation of unpromising clinical trials, saving time and funds.",

Utilizes a variety of data types and an opportunity to experience the journey of geospatial image data from its origin (raw data) to its end (transformation) in the context of the process, scope, and real-world scenarios. Examples provided with GBDX notebooks and customized work flows as entry to Python, cloud-based analytics, and web-based GUI software: ENVI, ArcGIS, and GBDX.",

Covers the underlying principles of the measurement techniques and the interaction of microwaves and LiDAR signals with natural surfaces and the atmosphere. Regarding radar, the course focuses on the role of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) systems and their application to monitoring aspects of the Earth's surface, including 3-D. Regarding LiDAR, the course introduces the different airborne and satellite systems and applications in terrestrial surfaces, principally for urban applications. Students complete a weekly lab project related to the processing and analysis of these data. Software: ArcGIS; ENVI; LIDAR Analyst; ESA SNAP Toolbox; ASF MapReady; ASF SAR Training Processor; USDA FS FUSION; FugroViewer.",

Originating in k12 instructional design contexts, Backward Design is now a core method for learning experience design across all higher education and corporate training contexts. \n\nIn this lab you will be introduced to the process of backward design, apply central concepts to your field or workplace context, and use the method to develop an engaging, authentic educational experience using the Canvas learning management system to demonstrates the proficiencies you have attained in the Backward Design method for learning design.",
