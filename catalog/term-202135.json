Offers students an opportunity to learn to take a complete view of the development process at the outset—across time, across the portfolio, and at all levels in the organization. This allows for greater insight into a drug’s potential early in the process and leads to a more focused program for promising compounds, including an optimized clinical trial design. It also allows for earlier cessation of unpromising clinical trials, saving time and funds.",

The heavily engaged policymaker has little use for intelligence products that emphasize prediction over explanation and opinion over evidence by assessments that trivialize the challenge of uncertainty by burying honest debate in compromise language and by ignoring high-impact contingencies.",
