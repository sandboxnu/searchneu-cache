These types of problems, called optimization problems, require an understanding of the derivative as a rate of change. The course focuses on how to apply rules and properties of derivatives to model and solve application problems in science, engineering, and technology. As a prelude to MTH 2105, at the end of the semester, the concept of the integral is introduced as a limit of sums and antidifferentiation.",
