Strand 2 introduces the tools and key components of an estate plan, such as Wills, Trusts, asset titling, and death beneficiary designations. Strand 3 weaves these together with and applies them to real-world frequently encountered situations using classroom hypotheticals to teach sound practice management, ethical considerations, blended family issues, and a mindset that plans for the knowable unknowns (e.g., not all potential beneficiaries may in the future be healthy, financially secure, still living, or even born yet).",

Through this experience, students learn how to properly conduct client/witness interviews and thorough factual investigations, to examine and cross-examine witnesses effectively and to make persuasive opening and closing statements. Students also learn how to write winning administrative appeals. The skills students learn in this course are easily transferable to any civil or criminal practice after law school. The course also presents a survey of the constitutional law relating to the sentencing process and the rights of prisoners while incarcerated and while on parole.",

Questions we will explore will include: What kinds of legal and institutional arrangements best facilitate economic growth? How does law structure and shape markets? What is “development” and how can it best be measured? Can legal instruments be used effectively to address underdevelopment in a structural way? While the focus will be on development in the so-called “developing world,” we will also explore some strategies for addressing development in a local community context. We will conclude the course by applying what we have learned to address several development case studies posing particular problems in particular regions and contexts.",

Black and Latinx women are the most severely rent-burdened tenants in the U.S., and their communities see the highest rates of eviction and housing displacement. The COVID-19 pandemic has only exacerbated these housing difficulties. Black and brown families experience higher rates of COVID-19 infections and deaths, and the impending wave of eviction filings will disproportionately harm their communities. The pandemic has demonstrated the need for approaches to housing justice that address the roots of systemic racial inequities. This course will examine legal tools and strategies like policy advocacy, litigation, and community lawyering for supporting marginalized individuals and communities and advancing racial equity in housing. The course will conclude by considering what cultural, legal, and political shifts are necessary to achieve a vision of housing as a human right.",
