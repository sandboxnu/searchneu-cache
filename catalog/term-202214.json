Analyzes sampling and quantization of continuous waveforms (A/D and D/A conversion), leading to the discussion of discrete-time FIR and IIR systems, recursive analysis, and realization. The Z-transform and the discrete-time Fourier transform are developed and applied to the analysis of discrete-time signals and systems.",
