We will approach this question by examining how the law and legal institutions shape racial identity and how ideas about race shape legal institutions.

We will excavate the stakes of these debates and the consequences (intended and unintended) of various legal reform projects designed to address racial inequality.",

This course explores the role of law in the defense of defenders, fundamental human rights, and the Earth. We will review normative foundations including the role of treaties within the U.S. legal framework, and the complex tapestry of federal and international norms intended to protect Indigenous Peoples, Original Nations, and the Earth. Our case studies will highlight challenges and limitations of those protections. Ultimately, the course is an invitation to re-imagine the law as a vehicle for social change and lawyering as “relational” in tandem with communities working to protect the Sacred against environmental destruction.",

The legal profession has recognized mindfulness as tool that can enhance the well-being of lawyers and improve the quality of lawyering. Mindfulness, being present in the moment with an attitude of non-judgment, heightens focus and equanimity—it sets the stage for meaningful communication and increased creativity. \n\nIn this course, students explore the practice of mindfulness to become creative problem-solvers and effective, empathetic students and advocates. Students engage in various practices for cultivating self-compassion and present moment awareness. Students learn how to practice mindfulness to find joy and decrease stress in the practice of law. This course offers techniques for incorporating mindfulness principles into life as a law student, as well as how to apply the principles to thinking about and solving legal issues. It also introduces strategies for employing mindfulness to improve cross-cultural communication and to minimize the danger of implicit bias.",

Students will write papers identifying and analyzing the issues germane to their topic.
