Fosters a deeper understanding of the principles of object-oriented programming and design including software components, object-oriented design patterns, and the use of graphical design notations such as UML (unified modeling language). Basic concepts in object-oriented design are illustrated with case studies in application frameworks and by writing programs in one or more object-oriented languages.",

Discusses the ways in which we can potentially remedy many of the issues involved in providing food for more than 7 billion people worldwide.",

Introduces analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog conversion concepts and the concepts of feedback and instability with applications to the design of amplifiers and oscillators. The course makes extensive use of the SPICE simulation tool for assignments and projects.",

Uses applications such as data analytics, artificial intelligence, signal processing, computer networks, electronic devices, and sensing systems as guiding examples. Begins with the basic theory of probability and random variables; then develops the concepts of random vectors, sequences, and processes with their statistical description. Introduces basic statistics, regression analysis, parameter estimation, and hypothesis testing, including the use of computer simulations. Defines the concepts of correlation, covariance, and power density spectra. Uses these concepts to discuss noise, uncertainty, and other random phenomena, which is covered in the context of electrical and computer engineering applications.",

Offers students an opportunity to learn core concepts that inform our understanding of how gender and sexuality are socially constructed and are experienced in everyday life. Drawing on women’s studies, queer studies, masculinity studies, and allied areas, the course analyzes gender, sexuality, and other dimensions of identity; explores critical issues of gender, sex, and power; and studies gendered/sexed identities in both national and transnational contexts. Topics include the gendered conceptions of love, sexuality, and violence; biological arguments about gender and sexuality; the social construction of sexuality and gender; intersections of gender, race, class, and sexuality; masculinities and femininities; theories of sexual difference; gender and the state; and gender and popular culture.",

Every building has a story to tell, yet few people are trained to “read” these stories, to look carefully and think critically about ordinary buildings and landscapes. This course will equip you with tools for interpreting the layered histories, power relations, and cultures that are inscribed in the built environment. We will examine histories of buildings––including houses, factories, shopping malls, courthouses, gas stations, and truck stops—as well as landscape elements—streets, highways, transit lines, yards, and parks—to understand the ways the built environment shapes everyday life. Unlike many architectural history courses, which highlight singular monuments designed by exceptional architects, this class focuses on the activities of broad set of actors—ranging from investors, builders, business leaders, and government officials to workers, social reformers, and activists—who have shaped the built environment in distinctive ways.",

This course investigates how architects, cinematographers and set designers have used film as a platform to critique or celebrate emerging architectural landscapes of this period. We will also discuss how during the decades that followed each of the two World Wars, film became a platform for testing out architectural fantasies and source for architectural inspiration. Our sessions consist of lectures followed by film screenings and discussions.",
