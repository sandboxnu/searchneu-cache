Uses applications such as data analytics, artificial intelligence, signal processing, computer networks, electronic devices, and sensing systems as guiding examples. Begins with the basic theory of probability and random variables; then develops the concepts of random vectors, sequences, and processes with their statistical description. Introduces basic statistics, regression analysis, parameter estimation, and hypothesis testing, including the use of computer simulations. Defines the concepts of correlation, covariance, and power density spectra. Uses these concepts to discuss noise, uncertainty, and other random phenomena, which is covered in the context of electrical and computer engineering applications.",

      "description": "Addresses how to engage in scientific, medical, and technological research in an ethically responsible manner. Research is crucial to understanding social, environmental, and health problems, as well as to developing effective responses to them. If the paradigm of responsible research is too restrictive, the benefits of scientific progress and technological innovation can be delayed or unrealized. At the same time, researchers have a responsibility to protect research subjects, to appropriately engage with members of the community, and to avoid behaving in ways that undermine scientific research in the long run. Explores the many ethical dimensions of research, and introduces students to the ethical foundations and controversies that are central to developing appropriate ethical frameworks for engaging in research.",

May be repeated up to three times.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n        Section information text:\r\n        Learn tools you'll be expected to know as a working software engineer, which will\nhelp you write better code, collaborate with others, and tackle problems you\npreviously thought impossible.\n\n\nEffective software development requires more than just coding skill: in industry and academia alike, developers use tools to keep their code maintainable and reliable. In this course, you will learn four fundamental categories of tooling: the command line, version control, build systems, and correctness. We’ll dive deep into one industry-standard tool from each category via hands-on projects and exploration of existing codebases, then survey other tools in the same category and discuss why you might choose one over another. By the end of the course, you will have a robust toolset both to manage complexity in your future projects and to effectively ramp up on software projects you encounter in the real world.\n\nWe are teaching this course as a series of four modules. The first, Command Line, will give you an overview of the operating system and tools available to you to make your life as a software engineer easier. The second, VCS, will teach you about how to version control your software with Git, so that you may maintain a history of your changes and collaborate with others. The third, Build, will teach you about how to reliably build your software with Make. The fourth and final module, Correctness, will introduce you to testing and other tools for ensuring that your software meets quality standards.",
