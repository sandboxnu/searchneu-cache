Offers students an opportunity to obtain a high-level understanding of big data technologies for data accessibility, efficiency, and security of data management at scale, including big data storage and computing technologies and big data analytics applications. Students create a working system for data acquisition and management using publicly available data sets and evaluate traditional data warehouse platforms as well as cloud-based big data storage and computing technologies. Azure is also introduced and used in the lab sessions.",

These differences extend to the opportunities available as well as the limitations and challenges faced by each. Discusses the symbiotic and potentially synergistic relationship that has developed between small, yet established, biotechnology companies and large medical device and pharmaceutical firms, as well as the impact of these relationships on the general economic environment.",

AI will radically transform all kinds of jobs over the next few years, from content creation to product development, bringing significant gains in employee productivity. At the center of it all is generative AI (GenAI). GenAI, a fascinating and unique advancement in AI technology, has garnered widespread public interest and ignited global enthusiasm. In this course, you will not only learn the core concepts and principles of GenAI and the foundations of natural language processing (NLP) related to GenAI but also witness its transformative potential in action through large foundational models, large language models, embeddings, related algorithms, and architecture highlighting typical use cases in various industries. This course equips students with a theoretical understanding of GenAI technologies and allows them to apply it in practical, hands-on projects. These projects are not just academic exercises but real-world applications of GenAI. Students will delve into new technologies, techniques, and applications of GenAI and natural language processing in their chosen industry (vertical) through special-topic research presentations. Students will also work in groups to create a working GenAI LLM-based chatbot using publicly available data, gaining valuable, hands-on experience in the field.",
