As a class, we will continually revisit the central question of “What (and when) is Islamic Art?” through critical engagement with topics including the creation of sacred spaces, artistic transmission, transregional connectivities, talismans and magic, consumption and networks of portability, museums and collecting, and contemporary art worlds. Our discussions aim to challenge accepted hierarchies within the field and expand the general definition of the aesthetic category of “Islamic Art.”",

      "description": "Covers many of the contested economic issues that the United States faces as a nation—the size of government, the national debt, the war on drugs, national healthcare, taxation, and many more. An important social system in any society is the economic system—the allocation of scarce resources. In the large and complex economy of the United States, there is controversy over what goods and services are produced and how they are distributed. To understand the nature and causes of these issues requires a course where theory is a tool of analysis, not the focus. Economics is not value free. Attention is given to the role of ethics and how our moral values shape policy. Course topics vary from semester to semester.",

Explores the importance of economic concepts such as externalities and elasticity in relation to a market-driven economy, price, and consumption behavior. Through the use of elementary life cycle analysis, introduces both the definition and responsibilities of the rational agent as these relate to the establishment of sustainable outcomes. Offers students an opportunity to articulate the relationship between economic growth and climate change and reconcile the historical relationship between social values and sustainable outcomes.",

Our world has grown increasingly complex and interconnected, and the planet’s diverse peoples are facing common problems that have tremendous impact on the immediate future. They are (1) globalization, from its origins in the sixteenth century to the present; (2) the potential for global pandemics to alter the course of history, from bubonic plague in the fifth century to H1N1; (3) racial inequality, from religious interpretations in the early modern period to science in the modern era; and (4) gender inequality, from the agricultural revolution forward. For each issue, studies cases and locations spread across the world, examines the links between past and present, and attempts to identify ways forward.",
