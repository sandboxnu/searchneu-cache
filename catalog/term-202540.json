Focuses on developing a practical understanding of the relationship between material, form, function, aesthetic and context, and a vocabulary to successfully articulate concepts and insights during discussions and critiques.",

Fosters a deeper understanding of the principles of object-oriented programming and design including software components, object-oriented design patterns, and the use of graphical design notations such as UML (unified modeling language). Basic concepts in object-oriented design are illustrated with case studies in application frameworks and by writing programs in one or more object-oriented languages.",

We'll discuss the rise of the surveillance state, the intersection of surveillance and race, and the spread of surveillance capitalism as we examine the technologies, aesthetics, and ethics of watching and being watched.",

Our world has grown increasingly complex and interconnected, and the planet’s diverse peoples are facing common problems that have tremendous impact on the immediate future. They are (1) globalization, from its origins in the sixteenth century to the present; (2) the potential for global pandemics to alter the course of history, from bubonic plague in the fifth century to H1N1; (3) racial inequality, from religious interpretations in the early modern period to science in the modern era; and (4) gender inequality, from the agricultural revolution forward. For each issue, studies cases and locations spread across the world, examines the links between past and present, and attempts to identify ways forward.",

Through careful reading of literature, class discussion, and lectures, familiarizes students with the study of design-related considerations that are an indispensable part of interpreting scientific literature. Offers students an opportunity to learn how to recognize critical elements of research design and execution (e.g., loss to follow-up in randomized clinical trials and other cohort designs, selection bias in case control studies, etc.); identify the strengths and limitations of different approaches to research questions; deepen their understanding of causal inference; and recognize the provisional nature of scientific knowledge. Covers issues of statistical methods and data analysis; however, there are no computational requirements.",

Every building has a story to tell, yet few people are trained to “read” these stories, to look carefully and think critically about ordinary buildings and landscapes. This course will equip you with tools for interpreting the layered histories, power relations, and cultures that are inscribed in the built environment. We will examine histories of buildings––including houses, factories, shopping malls, courthouses, gas stations, and truck stops—as well as landscape elements—streets, highways, transit lines, yards, and parks—to understand the ways the built environment shapes everyday life. Unlike many architectural history courses, which highlight singular monuments designed by exceptional architects, this class focuses on the activities of broad set of actors—ranging from investors, builders, business leaders, and government officials to workers, social reformers, and activists—who have shaped the built environment in distinctive ways.\n\nInformed by the fields of architectural history and cultural geography, this course will demand close attention to ordinary places and everyday spaces. It will ask you to analyze your own and others’ experience of buildings and urban spaces in order to write essays as well as other short forms of writing. In doing so, you will develop your abilities to clearly express your opinions through well-crafted arguments and back up those arguments through well-selected evidence. Regular feedback will help you critically examine your assumptions, make better sense of your perceptions, develop complex interpretations and to write more effectively about all of these things. The goal is greater self-awareness about your relationship to the built environment. Engaging with your everyday surroundings, a subject that is both familiar and inexhaustible, will challenge you to look attentively, expand your vocabularies and expressive capacities, and write with precision and conviction.",

We interact with objects - things, items, bits and bobs, tchotchkes, tools, totems - all day, every day. We have an innate understanding of their weight and tactility, and we make use of it constantly just moving around in the world, but we tend not to leverage this knowledge architecturally. In this course, we'll foreground the object and/of/in/as architecture, examining histories alongside our own experiences. Structured thematically, this course will look at the role objects play in our daily lives and in the production of spaces we understand to be architectural. We will look at materiality, fabrication, scale, agency, and collecting as varied means to understand these commonplace and thoroughly unknowable artifacts. With detours into theories of objecthood and genre, students will compose a series of reflections on ordinary objects, examining how context can cue meaning and value.",

Through a structured approach, students will learn how to define, scope, and articulate project ideas that address real-world chemical engineering challenges. The course will guide students in conducting need assessments, crafting precise problem statements, and performing market analyses to evaluate the potential impact and demand for their projects. Students will also gain an understanding of process and product requirements, including sourcing raw materials, and considering the environmental and social implications of their designs. Emphasis will be placed on research methodologies to identify key aspects of novel process designs and innovative solutions that meet customer and industry needs. Creativity stimulation techniques will be introduced to foster innovation, and students will learn how to assess the feasibility of their ideas, ensuring alignment with industry standards and market demands. By the end of this course, students will be equipped with the tools and techniques needed to bring a chemical engineering project idea from inception to a well-defined, market-ready concept. Learning outcomes: 1. Identify and Define Project Opportunities in chemical engineering by identifying gaps in current processes, technologies, or products that need innovative solutions. 2. Develop a Clear Problem Statement that describes the needs and technical challenges of a chemical engineering project idea. 3. Perform detailed need assessments for engineering problems to define design specifications and product goals, ensuring alignment with industry or societal demands. 4. Apply Creativity Stimulation Techniques to generate innovative chemical engineering project ideas, exploring multiple concepts and approaches to problem-solving. 5. Perform a thorough market analysis to determine competitors, potential market demand, and market share for the proposed project design or product. 6. Assess Feasibility of Design Ideas through technical, environmental, economic, and social lenses, ensuring the proposed design can be realistically implemented. 7. Identify and evaluate the sourcing of raw materials, as well as the environmental and social implications associated with process design and product usage. 8. Conduct targeted research to identify key aspects of a novel process or product design, understand industry trends, and assess customer needs. 9. Work effectively within teams to brainstorm, refine, and present innovative chemical engineering design solutions. 10. Communicate and defend the viability and innovation of project ideas in both written reports and oral presentations, integrating market, technical, and environmental justifications.",

Specific topics vary, but all are drawn from domains in which mathematics and computation play a significant role. Topics may include Fourier analysis with applications to vision and hearing, neural circuit computation, signal detection theory applied to human and nonhuman animals' decisions, measurement of sensory magnitudes in vision and hearing, the linear algebraic theory of color matching in humans, and analysis and models of human response time. Students complete weekly readings and a final project, typically involving use of software for data analysis.",
