We will evaluate the reasons for doubting or crediting these competing accounts, and will then consider their implications for determining appropriate legal doctrines and regulatory approaches. For example, we may consider whether the views of human behavior which shape consumer protection case law and the Supreme Court’s commercial speech doctrine are justified, and whether – and in what circumstances—regulations are appropriate which seek to help people by prescribing, proscribing, or “nudging” their behavior. Students are expected to participate in class and write a research paper which may satisfy the writing requirement.",

Advocates find that a human rights approach provides important strategic leverage and highlights the interdependence of economic, social, cultural, civil, and political rights.

We will approach this question by examining how the law and legal institutions shape racial identity and how ideas about race shape legal institutions.

People of color bear the brunt of the system: Black and Latinx children are overreported and investigated for alleged abuse and neglect, at greater risk of being removed from their home, and less likely to reunify with their families. These racial disparities plague the juvenile legal system, too. Even as the number of youth entering and moving through the system has gone down substantially over the past several years, the number of Black and Latinx youth swept into the juvenile legal system remains disproportionately high. The class seeks to understand how we got here and highlight the data, science, and best practices in transforming these systems. It will present a vision of legal representation that is holistic, zealous, trauma-informed, anti-racist, and client-driven.",
