Introduces students to the biological mechanisms and processes responsible for genetic inheritance, energy transfer, evolution, and population dynamics, providing a framework within which students may critically interpret and discuss important biological information provided in public forums. Seeks to empower students to make informed choices at the policy and personal levels. Offers students an opportunity to acquire an understanding of the basic principles of biology and apply the scientific process to the analysis of contemporary issues. Using a thematic approach, covers a wide range of issues including the reemergence of plagues, biological weapons and security, the environment, and human health and wellness.",

Uses PSpice software to simulate circuits and large-signal models and transient simulations to characterize the behavior of transistors in amplifiers and switching circuits. Digital electronics topics include CMOS logic gates, dynamic power dissipation, gate delay, and fan-out. Amplifier circuits are introduced with the evaluation of voltage transfer characteristics and the fundamentals of small-signal analysis.",
