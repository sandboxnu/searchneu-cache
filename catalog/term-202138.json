Students will produce podcasts on racially-motivated homicides, including lynchings and police killings, in the Jim Crow South from 1930-1970, drawn from cases from the CRRJ Burnham-Nobles Archive. They will learn the law applicable to racially-motivated violence, further the investigative work already done by CRRJ in investigating the killings, and produce podcasts that tell the factual, legal and human narratives based on selected cases from the archive. Working in groups, students will research the factual and legal issues presented by the podcast cases, identify and interview sources, learn how to write “for the ear”, and put together stories that include original audio interviews, archived sound and news clips, in order to craft a persuasive argument.  In addition to the weekly class meeting and readings, students will be expected to spend at least 5 hours per week working on case research and podcast production.",
