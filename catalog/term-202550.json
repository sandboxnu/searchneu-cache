Offers students an opportunity to obtain a deeper understanding of the principles of object-oriented programming and design, including software components, object-oriented design patterns, and the use of graphical design notations such as UML (unified modeling language).

Focuses on patient-centric care and includes development of an understanding of how nurse anesthetists can deliver high-quality care to improve patient outcomes and the safety environment adherence to individual and systemic safety processes. Students incorporate didactic knowledge into developing anesthesia management plans for patients across the acuity and age continuum. With continual guidance, offers students an opportunity to assume increasing responsibility for more care of increasingly complex patients and surgical procedures.",
