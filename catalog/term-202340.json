Considers the instantiation of objects, the trade-offs of stack vs. heap allocation, and the design of constructors and destructors. Emphasizes the need for a strategy for dynamic memory management. Addresses function and operator overloading; templates, the Standard Template Library (STL), and the STL components (containers, generic algorithms, iterators, adaptors, allocators, function objects); streams; exception handling; and system calls for processes and threads.",

May be repeated up to six times.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n        Section information text:\r\n        Introduce students to significant and influential movements in Eastern European art and design history, such as Suprematism, Constructivism, Productivism, Socialist Realism and Nonconformist art, and explores both the ways in which art was instrumentalized by the Soviet state and the ways in which artists reacted against that instrumentalization in later years. By analyzing posters, costume and set designs, socialist realist paintings, and performances, and creating them themselves, students understand the ways in which artists sought to become producers and create work that perfectly embodied the burgeoning socialist state, and later used coded language to create work that reacted against that increasingly failing state.",
